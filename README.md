# GTFS to GeoJson

This Rust crate is used to convert GTFS data to the GeoJSON format. 

## Installing Crate

[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/gtfs-geojson)

While the repo is named `gtfs-to-geojson` the crate is called `gtfs_geojson` and can me installed using 

```bash
cargo add gtfs_geojson
```

## Functions

The `gtfs_geojson` library use the `gtfs_structures` library and its types to convert gtfs files over to geojson.

### extract_stops(&gtfs: &gtfs_structures::Gtfs) -> Vec<Feature>

`extract_stops` will export all of the stops and their properties from the gtfs.


### extract_trips_shapes(&gtfs: &gtfs_structures::Gtfs) -> Vec<Feature>

`extract_trips_shapes` will export all of the shapes as line features from the shapes.txt file and add in trip information for each feature in the geojson properties from trips.txt.
